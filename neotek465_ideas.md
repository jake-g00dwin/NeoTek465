# NeoTek465 Ideas


**Visual:**

For the visual aspect I want to preserve the interface as much as possible 
while also showcasing the internals and the new design.

Basically I'm going to treat it much like many of the PC builds I've done
before, case lighting, transparent side panel and cable sleeving.

For the knobs, I want all of them to be built to last....forever.

I hate the plastic knobs as they have aged badly and now are almost all
cracked and disintegrating.

I also with the entire things had better protection for the user interface.

The front face is totally exposed, I think adding in "bumper bars" or some
kind of protective cover would really be cool.

Even better if the panel is fancy and does a cool sliding action thing.

The mechanized retro-futuristic design of 80's anime mecha is the goal.

I'm thinking metal front panel with stamped and etched lettering and for 
sure some extra backlighting or indicators.

**Extra Features:**

- USB interface.
- RJ45 interface
- RS232/485 interface.
- Digital info injection to CRT display.
- Multi Function generator for calibration.
- Automatic Sleep functionality.
- Backup battery settings system.
- Touch screen digitizer.
- Motorized controls?
- Built in component curve tracer module.

Maybe somehow including a basic signal decoder or classifier?

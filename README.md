# NeoTek465
A re imagining of the Tektronix 465 Oscilloscope


The project is broken into two parts, the neo version of the schematics and
PCB files and the original version.

The original version is my best attempt to create a 1 for 1 replica of the 
original boards and schematics.


## Project Goals

- Modernize the power supply system for higher efficiency.
- Substitute parts with:
    - digitalized magnetic encoders.
    - fiberglass --> carbon fiber rods.
    - Carbon resistors --> 1% or greater metal film.
    - Aluminum electrolytic --> Equivalent Hybrid solid state caps.
    - Improved EMI through shielding and multi layered PCBs.
    - Standardized connectors and wiring harness.
    - Lamps --> LEDs.
- New Low noise temperature control system.
- Transparent showcase shell.

## Roadmap

**Original:**

- [ ] Recreate Original Schematics:
- [ ] Recreate Original PCBs:
- [ ] Capture Pictures of original
- [ ] Capture components values via measurements from multiple samples. 

**NeoTek465:**

- [ ] Create total feature list
- [ ]
